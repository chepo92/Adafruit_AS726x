# Adafruit AS726xSoftWire Library 

This is a library for the Adafruit AS7262 spectral sensor breakout:
  * https://www.adafruit.com/products/3779
using the Softwire library in case you don't have available the SDA and SCL pins, or you want to connect devices with the same i2c address. 

I added an example of use with pins 2 and 3 

Also supports other chips in the AS726x sensor family.
 
Check out the links above for our tutorials and wiring diagrams. This chip uses I2C to communicate
